Tasks of Glory

A lightweight Tkinter task manager that helps procrastinators stay productive by balancing quick wins against urgent deadlines.

Tasks are ranked by Ease (how simple/fast) and Urgency (how time-sensitive). The app computes a Priority score so high-urgency tasks bubble up—without ignoring the value of easy wins.

Features

✅ Add, complete, and edit tasks

🔀 Drag-to-rank by Ease or Urgency (handle shows for active column)

⚖️ Auto-computed Priority; one-click “Sort by Priority”

💾 Tasks persist to tasks.txt in the app folder
